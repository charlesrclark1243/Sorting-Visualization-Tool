## Synopsis
This is a sorting algorithm visualization tool implemented using Python and the Tkinter library. Its purpose is to help students learning computer science to better understand how certain sorting algorithms work by observing them in action.

## Dependencies
This tool has been implemented and tested using the following dependency versions:
 - Python 3.10.4
 - Tk 8.6

## Algorithms Included
**v1.0 (Upcoming)**
- Insertion Sort.
- Selection Sort.
- Bubble Sort.

**v2.0 (Planned)**
- Merge Sort.
- Heap Sort.

## Requirements
**Mandatory**
- [ ] User can generate a randomized ordering of the list of integers described by the interval [1, 50] by pressing a button.
- [ ] User can see each number in the list of integers represented as a rectangle in the visualization area, where the height of each box is related to the value of the number it represents.
- [ ] User can select a sorting algorithm to be used by selecting from a list of algorithms.
- [ ] User can start the sorting process by pressing a button.
- [ ] User can see the update in ordering associated with each iteration of the sorting process through the shifting of the rectangles in the visualization area.

**Nice-to-Haves**
- [ ] User can select the upper bound on the list of integers, up to a certain maximum value.
- [ ] User can select different speeds from a list of qualitative options, e.g, "Fast," "Slow."
